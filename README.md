# WorkSchedule - jQuery
In this challenge im working with an existing file and using jQuery to clone, give attributes and save data from the original html file.

## Functionality

To begin the user will be able to see the current hour (red color), the hours that have been completed (color gray) and the next hours (color green).
Each color represents past, present and future. The user may be able to introduce its information into the text area and save it into the local storage if the user doesnt click the save button the information will not be stored. Once the information is saved it will appear even if the page was reloaded.
On the top theres a button to delete all the information.
